The following files need to be read in this order:

1) EDA - Capstone
2) Capstone - Preliminary Analysis
3) Capstone - Modeling
4) Capstone - Predictions

There around 4-6 csv files that were actually used in the notebooks, the others are supplemntary for me to look at

The png files are of the cluster results

The report has been provided in doc and pdf format it is the one called NBA Draft Day Comparisons Report.pdf

The rookie line predicitons can be found in the pdf or power point file, the pdf is obvious in its name to be identified. This is to supplement the end of the last file for predicitions,
I just took the comparisons rookie stats and altered them to see fit for each player.

Comments for the actual code were limited as there was redundancies present in a lot of copying and pasting of code, so time was saved here, as well the markdown cells do a good job explaining
whats going on.

new_a_cluster is the NBA cluster stat results

the sole .xlsx file is for me to copy and past names into the predictions files


Thank you for a great cohort, stay safe, all the best
